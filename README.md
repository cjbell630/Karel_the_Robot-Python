## Installing
**Karel the Robot is now on PyPi!!!**

To install, run:

>
    pip install karel_the_robot

Some IDEs (such as PyCharm) might be able to automatically run this command if you type the import sequence.

Additionally, when using [repl.it](https://repl.it/), you may have to import manually.
To do so, follow these steps within your repl:

* Click the "Packages" tab
* Search for and select "karel-the-robot" (dashes instead of underscores)
* Press the plus (+) symbol by the package name

<br>

Once installed, the recommended way to import is:

>
    from karel_the_robot import World, Robot

Of course, there are numerous other ways to import.
